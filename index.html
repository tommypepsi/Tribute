When Trisha dies of the plague, the brothers perform the forbidden alchemic
          technique of human transmutation in an attempt to resurrect her. Consequently, the transmutation backfires and in law with equivalent exchange, Edward's left leg and Alphonse's entire body are destroyed. Edward sacrifices his right arm to rescue
          Alphonse's soul, binding it to a suit of armor with a blood seal. Edward is invited by Roy Mustang to become a State Alchemist to research a way to restore Alphonse's body. Edward succeeds, becoming the Fullmetal Alchemist, the title based on his
          prosthetic automail limbs and use of alchemy involving metal materials.

            <h4>Alphonse Elric</h4></a>
          Alphonse Elric is a fictional character in the manga and anime series Fullmetal Alchemist. He is a human child who lost his body during a forbidden alchemical transmutation to bring his deceased mother back to life, and had his soul transmuted into a suit of armor by his brother, Edward Elric. Al's blood seal lies just below the base of the neck at the back of the suit, on the inside. It is drawn with Ed's blood. According to Edward, he needs to be careful whenever he reconstructs Alphonse's body because he must keep the blood seal intact during the transmutation. If the blood seal is removed, Al's soul will be lost.

          <h4>Edward Elric</h4></a>
          Edward "Fullmetal Alchemist" Elric is a young alchemical prodigy. He is the youngest State Alchemist ever to be recognized by the Amestris State Military, having received the title at the age of 12. Ed's primary motivation throughout the series is to return his younger brother, Alphonse, to his original body, which was lost in a failed human transmutation. Edward, despite his occasional bouts of immaturity, is a selfless boy who gains a reputation as a "hero of the people" throughout his youth. Notably, he doesn't seem concerned about returning his own arm and leg, instead focusing entirely on Al's suffering.

          <h4>Winry Rockbell</h4></a>
           childhood friend of the central characters, the Elric brothers, she is often seen in their company throughout the series. She is evidently Edward's love interest. Specializing in mechanical repair, specifically with automail, Winry services Edward's arm and leg whenever it is in need of repair or replacement.

          <h4>Scar</h4></a>
          Scar seeks his revenge against the state alchemists, all of whom he blames for the destruction of Ishbal. His wrath does not extend, however, to non-state alchemists, which is why he does not seek to kill Alphonse Elric during their frequent confrontations.

          <h4>Maes Hughes</h4></a>
          Maes Hughes is a character that is hard not to love. He is often seen as the comedy relief but has his debuts as a serious and skilled fighter. He is best friends with Roy Mustang (and would do anything to help Roy achieve his goals) and a loving and devoted husband/father. Maes would do anything for his wife Gracia and always carries pictures of his daughter Elycia in his uniform and never misses a chance to show everyone how cute she is. He starts out in the anime as a Major in the Investigation Division and eventually becomes a Lieutenant Colonel.

          <h4>Roy Mustang</h4></a>
          Outwardly arrogant and playfully manipulative, Mustang is intelligent and almost always one step ahead of his opponents, and likes to feel in control of the situation. He is one of the superiors of Edward Elric. On the surface, he appears to be nothing more than a man of the military who pursues promotions and praise and is considered a ladies' man who constantly goes on dates with different women. Mustang's true goal is to become Führer in order to gain the power to reform the government in order to absolve his sins in the Ishval War as well as change the country for the better, along with the joking requirement for female officers to wear tiny miniskirts (which considerably increased Havoc's loyalty to him and caused Hawkeye to be angry with him).

            <h4>Alex Louis Armstrong</h4></a>
          Major Alex Louis Armstrong, the Strong Arm Alchemist, was born into an elite family of alchemists and has mastered his family's techniques. Members of his family have, in the past, filled the highest military and political positions in the state. He acquired his alchemy titles for his skill of using arm strength in his alchemy. All though he may look intimidating, he is really friendly and (overly)affectionate, and often stays behind or risks his life for the safety of others. He also has a tendency to show off techniques passed down to him to his enemies, and make them feel somewhat awkward during a battle.

            <h4>Van Hohenheim</h4></a>
          He is the father of the protagonists, Edward and Alphonse Elric. He is a brilliant and well-known alchemist. He left Ed, Al, and their mother Trisha when Al was a baby and Ed was very young. Years later, Ed still holds a grudge against him for abandoning his mother, which he believes contributed to her death.
